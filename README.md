# reddit_most_reposted
visualization of subreddits with maximum number of reposted images

The dataset was "resubmitted content on reddit" taken from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection. Reddit is one of the most popular online communities with subreddits on various topics. Some of the content is posted on various subreddits multiple times, sometimes on the same subreddit.

A subset of the data was used. I have used only the subset of image_id and subreddit names.
The size of the circles in the visualization are representative of the relative popularity of subreddits and the thickness of the edges between circles show the degree to which they have common reposted content.

The visualization shows that the subreddit r/funny has the most reposted content. It also shows that the same content is reposted multiple times on different subreddits as shown by the thickness of the edges between circles showing popular subreddits.
